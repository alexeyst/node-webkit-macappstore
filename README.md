# Mac AppStore patch for node-webkit
This patch is totally based on this work: https://github.com/rogerwang/chromium.src/pull/17

The original patch by @trevorlinton did not work with 0.11.5, so fixed it for the newer version until node-webkit official repository gets updated with the proper changes and buildbot for Mac AppStore file.
